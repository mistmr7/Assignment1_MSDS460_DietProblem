This is a repository for solving The Diet Problem using five food items (vegetable mix, rice, milk, eggs, chicken) and using the following nutritional constraints:

Component

Max/Min

Daily Amount and measure

Sodium: Maximum 5,000 milligrams (mg)

Energy: Minimum 2,000 Calories (kilocalories, kcal)

Protein: Minimum 50 grams (g)

Vitamin D: Minimum 20 micrograms (mcg)

Calcium: Minimum 1,300 milligrams (mg)

Iron: Minimum 18 milligrams (mg)

Potassium: Minimum 4,700 milligrams (mg)

main.py is a file with four separate solutions: 

An ideal solution allowing some items to be omitted
A solution where at least one serving of each is required
A solution with 1 serving of chicken and 1 serving of milk required per day and at least one of the other 3 items
A realistic solution where eggs are capped at 5 per day and rice is capped at 3 servings per day

chatgptsolution.py contains the output code of chatgpt solving the problem ensuring at least one of each item is used.

The pdf file includes the writeup, photos of each nutritional label in Appendix I, the weekly food nutrition table with a recipe for the vegetables in Appendix II, the discussion with ChatGPT in Appendix III, and a table of the results of the solutions for each of the constraints in Appendix IV.
